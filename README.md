# FinGuard
FinGuard is a lightweight financial controls and transaction-validation platform inspired by enterprise SAP S/4HANA and SAP Ariba workflows. It ingests daily transaction data, validates schema and business rules, flags high-risk exceptions, and automatically produces audit-ready reports and alerts.
